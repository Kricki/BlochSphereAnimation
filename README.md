# BlochSphereAnimation
Animation of qubit states and gates on Bloch sphere.

The animation is based on the Bloch sphere plots provided by QuTiP.

## Installation
### Special requirements 
* [QuTiP](https://qutip.org) >= 4.6
* Matplotlib: Plotting of the sphere does not work with matplotlib 3.5 or 3.5.1. This is a bug in QuTiP. Versions 3.4.x seem to work fine.
* Python >= 3.8

### Installation procedure
* Clone or download the repository
* `python setup.py install` or `pip install .` should work
* Alternatively: Just use the Jupyter notebook example.

## Examples
See /examples.
